# Pdf2Image

Steps:

Run this command in you cmd: "pip install pdf2image"

The version that I used for the Poppler is "Release-21.11.0-0". You can download it.

When you download the zip file then unzip it and placed the folder here "C:\Program Files"

After that you have to just run my code and easily got the results from pdf to image.
